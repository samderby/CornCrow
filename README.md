# CornCrow
A Crow is a friendly game you can play on your own time at your own pace with no pressure to "taek care" of things.


here are the basics

the crow has a "sidekick" you can also take care of but dont have to. The running name is Pooky. 

Open questions:

How many items in total does the crow give and take? 50-100. Change is based on price and use. 


///Tutorial///
Introduce the concept and show the player around with „got it“ buttons. Give enough money to buy the basic equipment. Get a couple simple things or buy something good. Main character has a friend that he can feed. 

Collect chimes or something that you can put out and see how fancy the crow is that shows up. 

///General concept///

We feed the crow “snacks”. Peanuts, worms etc and in return he gives us various items we can use, give away or keep for later. We can even use the things we get for later to attracked the crows to come back again or for more exotic birds to show up for example. 

We have our own for of currency named TDB. Big rewards for big money. The big rewards give you fun results.  
Start with a little to buy stuff.

///Crow behavior///

Crow brings you four kinds of things. Randomly 

1 - Paper chimes Most common thing you keep getting worth least currency. Or can harvest this. The crow can bring you this currency so you can quickly harvest. 

Create a pattern in the user. Like currency or feeling about when to do stuff. 

2 - Wood chimes or something like that. Not that many or special chime that you can reuse. 

3 - Metal chimes


You can harvest corn and pop some of it for special rewards
4- collectible items 

Popcorn popper - make the user figure out how to use it to pop porn and give it to the crow.

This is where you see the crow and his friends. There is an option to expand the window view so you can see the corn outside to pick. But its not obvious and thats ok. 

Timing
Crow behavior is randomized so you dont know when they will show up.
Items he drops are randomized until there are charmes. With each level of charm the "better" things he brings you
Crow drops off and does NOT come back until you pick up what he dropped off(if you dont give him food he drops off dea animals or things you dont want) and give him food.
